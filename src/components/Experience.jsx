              I've gained valuable experience developing multiple MERN stack
              projects. From creating robust APIs with Express.js and Node.js to
              building dynamic user interfaces with React, these projects have
              enhanced my skills in end-to-end web development. Collaborating
              with cross-functional teams, I've learned to adapt quickly and
              deliver high-quality solutions
